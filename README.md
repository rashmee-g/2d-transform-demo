# 2D Matrix Transformations Demo

This project is a browser-based simulation that demonstrates how basic **2D matrix transformations**â€”translation, rotation, scaling, and compositionâ€”are applied to graphical objects using **Linear Algebra**.

## Purpose

This demo was created as part of a final project for **MAT-210: Linear Algebra (Summer 2025)** to explore how matrix operations underpin 2D graphics in gaming and interactive media. It visualizes transformations on a triangle (representing a simple game object) using **JavaScript**, **HTML5 Canvas**, and **homogeneous coordinates**.

## Concepts Demonstrated

- 2D matrix multiplication
- Homogeneous coordinates
- Translation matrix
- Rotation matrix
- Scaling matrix
- Composite transformations (e.g. Rotate + Translate)
- Real-time coordinate updates

## ðŸ–¥Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- JavaScript for all logic and matrix math
- CSS for styling

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/2d-transform-demo.git
